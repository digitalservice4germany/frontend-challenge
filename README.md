# GovData Dashboard

[GovData.de](https://www.govdata.de/) is the data portal for Germany. The federal, state and local governments can share their data.

## Your Task

Create a small web application that provides a dashboard showing how many data sets each federal ministry has made available on GovData. The dashboard should provide the possibility to filter the currently shown result set. It should be easy to tell from the dashboard which ministries have provided the most data.

Data for the dashboard is going to be provided by a backend in the future, but such an API is not in place yet (imagine your colleagues are working on it). In the meantime please execute `npx json-server backend-response.json` to create a sample API locally. Please let your web application fetch the data from that local API.

Use a non-proprietary tech stack of your choice and explain in a readme how to run your solution. Please use version control (git is preferred).

## Submitting your solution

You have two options for submitting your solution:

1. Hosted repository (preferred)

Please email a link to a GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab/etc. repo to [challenge@digitalservice.bund.de](mailto:challenge@digitalservice.bund.de). Make sure to make the repo private 3 days after the interview.

2. Email

Alternatively, you can email your solution as a zip file to [challenge@digitalservice.bund.de](mailto:challenge@digitalservice.bund.de). Make sure to include the commit history in your submission.

## Evaluation

We want to use this challenge to understand how you would approach such a problem in a work setting.

We are going to pay attention to:

- an accessible and usable solution
- how you structure your application and your source code,
- a robust understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- how you test your application and what kinds of tests you're writing,
- how you document your application, including instructions to run the project,
- what your commits look like,
- what tooling you use,
- overall consistency & attention to detail.

You should turn in a complete and runnable solution, but do not gold-plate it: we don't expect you to spend more than a few hours on this exercise.

In the technical interview that follows we would like to discuss your approach, and that includes talking about areas you would want to improve if given more time.

## Have fun! ðŸš€

We look forward to your submission! Please [let us know](mailto:challenge@digitalservice.bund.de) if you have any questions or concerns.
